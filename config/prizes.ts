// Era table for สลากกินแบ่งรัฐบาล (Thai Government Lottery) prize/ticket
// history, ascending by `from`.
//
// Research summary (see task-2-report.md for full source list + approx notes):
//   - Current era (2015-08-01 -> today) is the brief's known-correct anchor;
//     values kept verbatim, NOT re-derived from research.
//   - Pre-2015 era: confirmed via GLO restructuring coverage that (a) the
//     first prize was 4,000,000 THB immediately before the 2558 (2015)
//     restructuring that raised it to 6,000,000 THB and abolished the
//     jackpot; (b) front3 ("เลขหน้า 3 ตัว") did not exist yet -- the older
//     format paid 4 separate last-3-digit prizes ("เลขท้าย 3 ตัว 4 รางวัล"),
//     confirmed directly by the actual 16 Jun 2558 draw result showing four
//     last-3-digit numbers; (c) the 40THB ticket face price documented for
//     GLO tickets ran from 1987 through the 2017 single-ticket reform.
//   - near/second/third/fourth/fifth/last3 amounts for the pre-2015 era
//     could NOT be independently verified with a source in this session,
//     so per the "no fabrication" rule they are copied forward from the
//     nearest documented (current) era and the whole era is flagged
//     `approx: true`.
//   - last2 ("เลขท้าย 2 ตัว") IS independently sourced (not copied): the
//     official GLO prize table reproduced on English Wikipedia
//     ("Thai_lottery" article, table titled "Official Prizes for Thai
//     Government and Thai Charity Lotteries on 1 August 2014 - 16 July
//     2015" -- i.e. the period immediately before the Aug 2558/2015
//     restructuring) lists "Match 2 digits (1 time): 10,000 prizes,
//     Payout 1,000 baht". That is the value used here.
